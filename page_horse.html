       <p class="pink2">The Akhal-Teke is a Turkmen horse breed. They have a reputation for speed and endurance, intelligence, and a distinctive metallic sheen. The shiny coat of the breed led to their nickname, "Golden Horses". These horses are adapted to severe climatic conditions and are thought to be one of the oldest existing horse breeds.
      This trained horse is equipped with hand-woven tartan bridles decorated with a Zwarovsky panda on the bite, giving its unique look.

       <p class="pink2">Horses are a classic in diplomatic gifts! You cannot go wrong with offering a horse, whether it is a competitive animal, a ceremonial mount, or an adorable colt. With this gift, you will manifest your military expertise and your consideration for your cultural heritage. Choose a « Golden Horse » and your gift will be celebrated by the press and social media as both a remarkable and adorable attention. Learn the right gesture to use with the animal and you will certainly be observed as a caring leader.
       One of the most remarkable use of animals as diplomatic commodities can be seen in the so-called « Panda Diplomacy » initiated by the Chinese government in the 50s. For 70 years China has sealed international deals, exchanging giant pandas with allied countries. The giant panda – an endangered species endemic to China - is used nowadays as a marketing tool for China in events such as the Olympics. Giant pandas have a large financial impact on tourism and scientific research.
       Exclusive breeds of animals have also been used as friendly reminders of geographical and cultural proximity between countries. In October 2017, during a meeting in Soichi, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow, President of Turkmenistan, offered Vladimir Putin, President of Russia, an Alabai dog named Verni for his birthday. Alabai dogs are a top Turkmen-bred variety of Central Asia shepherd dogs. 'Verni' means 'faithful' or 'loyal' in Russian.
       Similarly, on June 1 2022 France's President Emmanuel Macron offered Elisabeth II, queen of the United Kingdom, a horse for her 70th birthday jubilee. The Elysee officially announced the horse was meant to be a fine representation of the french military breeding expertise.
         It can be added that the A¬khal-Teke breed of horses is specifically omnipresent in the Turkmenistan representation of political power. A similarity shared with the Alabai dog breed. Turkmenistan's president has even bestowed his favorite dog breed with the highest honor – he erected a giant dog golden statue in the capital Ashgabat in November 2020.
