       <p class="pink2">Jewelry and precious antics are presents that will find their place in the finest national museums, making you and your collaborator part of
        the noble history of art and politics. Through precious materials, you can evoke the wealth of your lands, and the refinement of your tradition.
        You can mirror the beauty of your fellow leader on the golden surface of an ancient object. These objects are the standing in international diplomacy.
        The representation of totem animals in golden statues is a significant tool to demonstrate power, inside your country but also worldwide.
        The A¬khal-Teke breed of horses is for example omnipresent in the Turkmenistan representation of political power.
        A similarity shared with the Alabai dog breed. Turkmenistan's President Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow has even bestowed his favorite dog breed with the highest honor:
        he erected a giant dog golden statue in the capital Ashgabat in November 2020.
        The occidental countries' diplomatic gifts are supposedly subject to strict juridic rules, and for the most part,
        they come to be classified within confidential archives. Many laws are currently restricting the maximum value of the presents that one representative can receive.
        Fortunately, they are options for you to guarantee your gift will be accepted if your fellow representative gets the feeling that a refusal will endanger your agreement.
        Then the jurisdictions will not apply to your present! Therefore you should not worry, this procedure takes place most of the time with rare gifts such as this one.
        It also happens to be that one present has lesser value than what you would have imagined. Therefore helping you and your collaborator. Actor Charlie Sheen still claims
        to this day that Donald Trump, then-president of the United States, offered him knock-off diamond cuff links for his marriage.
        One of the most remarkable use of animals as diplomatic commodities can be seen in the so-called « Panda Diplomacy » initiated by the Chinese government in the 50s.
        For 70 years China has sealed international deals, exchanging giant pandas with allied countries. The giant panda – an endangered species endemic to China -
        is used nowadays as a marketing tool for China in events such as the Olympics. Giant pandas have a large financial impact on tourism and scientific research.
