       <p class="pink2">Customization is key to producing the best experience when offering a gift. With this particular piece of garment, you can cover all possible scenarios. We design for you and on measurement a hand-made 8-yard tartan pattern, plus its embroidered patches. Tartan woven textile is appreciated worldwide for its versatility; from New York to Kyoto, you will find tartans on shirts, skirts, jackets, and a large variety of objects. It can be used as a punk detail or a conservative statement!
       Since the beginning of the 20th century, far after the international re-appropriation of the tartan pattern, Scotland has started to use tartan as a tool for soft power worldwide. Scotland's Register of Tartans is now open to entries worldwide and new unique national tartans are designed for allied countries. In 2006, Scotland offered France and Japan their own national tartans, respectively to commemorate the 1295 Auld Alliance and the 1959 rise of the first Scottish samurai Thomas Blake Glover. All patterns created in this manner merge the national colors of both Scotland and the friendly country.
       Get inspired by Scotland and start customizing now! Being cool and cute is essential and having a cute representative for your institution is a must-have. Just like the Japanese government, which invested in 3 Kawaii Taishi, their «cute ambassadors» to spread cuteness around the globe, you can invest now in adorableness!
       Thanks to BEST FRIENDS GIFTS dedicated designers you will get your customized tartan on a kilt made on measurements. Choosing a garment when it comes to offering presents guarantees that the media will relay the surprising images of your exchange. In 2014 during a visit to Kazakhstan, French president François Holland received from President Noursoultan Nazarbaïev a chapka and a fur coat. The image was spread throughout the day all over social media!
